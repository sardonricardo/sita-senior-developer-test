# SITA - Senior Developer Technical Test

This repository contains my solution to the SITA Senior Developer Technical Test.
It consists of two exercises, each implemented in its own Typescript file.

Each exercice has its own test function.

## Setup

Install `ts-node` globally if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g ts-node
```

### How to run

```bash
ts-node 1_JS_Concurrancy.ts
ts-node 2_LicensePlate.ts
```
